## Prerequisites

Complete steps mentioned under [Prerequisites](Prerequisites.md)

## 1. Simple Chain

We will create a simple chain and execute using AzureOAI, OpenAI and optionally one or more local models

- [Simplechain ReadMe](1-SimpleChain/README.md)

## 2. VectorDB-RAG

We will use a specific document and create embeddings in PineCone VectorDB and use Retrieval Agents of LangChain to perform RAG


- Embeddings
- Retrieval Chain
- LangChain Hub Agents

## 3. IceBreaker

Given a name of a person, this agent based app fetches the social and professional profile and provides few fun facts - a good icebreaker when you meet the person firstime.
